*** requirements
**** a user should only see a sublist of other users (ie christmas for familly x)
**** a user should see all gifts to another member of the group from any user
     (even from outside the current group)
**** a gift is offered at some party
*** proposal
    once the user is logged in, there are two drop down menus:
    - one for the party selection
    - one for the user selection

    the party drop down only shows the one where the user is a member

    the user drop down only shows the member of the selected party

    the list shows all gifts made to this user, even from members
    outside the party


    there is a "manage parties" button, which allows to create new
    parties, add/remove members by checking/unchecking boxes and
    archive parties.

    when a party is archived, it is no longer displayed in the drop
    down, and gifts linked to it are also hidden.

    note: I think anyone should be able to edit anything, but we could
    also limit this feature to special "admin" users
